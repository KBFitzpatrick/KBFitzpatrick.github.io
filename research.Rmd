Recreational fisheries, models that incorporate ecological knowledge and meet management needs


### Multispecies Stock Assessments ###

In collaboration with with Lake Ontario managers and biologists, I developed a multispecies statistical catch-at-age model to estiamte the joint populations of two recreational fisheries, Chinook Salmon and Lake Trout, and their shared primary prey species, Alewife. This model emphasizes the predator-prey dynamcis that are core Great Lakes fisheries management. 

### Resource-Efficenct Managemnt and Monitoring Tools ###

Limited financial and personell resources are a reality for conservation and managment organizations, yet are still rarely incorporated directly into assessment tools. Across my research topics, I have explored how ecological knowledge can inform cost-effective managment actions and montioring programs.

My past research has used individual-based models to evaluate the return-on-investment of barrier removals for restoring habitat for stream-resident and migratory fishes. 

Currently, I am working with NYSDEC and OMNDMNRF researchers to evaluate mass marking programs that are cost-effective, informative, and that align with manamegemnt procedures. 

### Parentage-based Tagging ###

Stocked wild important for Lake O. 

Since 2018, tissue samples from all Lake Ontario Chinook Salmon broodmothers have been collected to support this program even under staff-limiting Covid-19 restrictions.

This research would not have been feasible without the support of NYSDEC and OMNDMNRF staff during collections.

### Spatial Ecology ###

Understanding how ecological, environmental, and anthprogenic factors interact across space can help guide managment and conservation actions. At OU, I identified and evaluated how a suite of indicator species could inform spatially optimal barrier removals for native fish habitat restoration.
